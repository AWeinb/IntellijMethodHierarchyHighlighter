# IntellijMethodHierarchyHighlighter
Plugin to easier grasp the method call hierarchy in a JAVA class.

The usability is not great at the moment. You have to press Ctrl+Alt+Q
or use the menu entry in the CODE menu to test it. On top of that the colors are
not configurable. At this state it's more or less a prototype :)

The zip file in the root directory contains a packed version of this
prototype and may be installed via the settings menu of IntelliJ.
Use the 'Install plugin from disc' button.
