Plugin to easier grasp the method call hierarchy in a JAVA class.

The usability is not greate at the moment. You have to press Ctrl+Alt+A
to test it. Also the colors are not configurable. It's more or less
a prototype :)

The zip file in the root directory contains a packed version of this
prototype and may be installed via the settings menu of IntelliJ.
Use the 'Install plugin from disc' button.
